# Bayesian Network for Lymphography Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing lymphography data using Bayesian networks. The goal is to model the conditional dependencies between lymphography features and gain insights into the underlying relationships.

## Files

### 1. BayesianNetwork.ipynb
- Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
- Explore the dataset, build a Bayesian network, and perform inference.
- Includes visualizations of the network structure.

### 2. Data
- **lymphography_data.csv**: Dataset with lymphography data.
- **lymphography_names.csv**: Descriptions of dataset features.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebook).
3. Open `BayesianNetwork.ipynb` to run the analysis.

## Usage
- Use the Bayesian network to predict lymphography outcomes based on observed features.
- Experiment with different network structures and priors to improve accuracy.
